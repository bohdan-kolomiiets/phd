Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a non-invasive method used for human–machine interaction, but its practical use is often limited by large differences between individuals and the effort needed to train models for each new user. This study explores whether transfer learning can help solve these problems when using deep learning to classify hand and wrist gestures. The experiments were conducted on a dataset that includes eleven gestures, each repeated eight times by 22 healthy participants. Three training approaches were tested: (i) training and testing on the same subject (intra-subject), (ii) training on some subjects and testing on a new one (inter-subject), and (iii) transfer learning with and without resetting the fully connected (FC) output layer of the convolutional neural network (CNN). All models were evaluated using a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy across both subjects and repetitions.
Results show that both transfer learning methods performed better than the other two approaches in terms of classification accuracy. The best result was achieved when the FC layer was reset before fine-tuning (F1-score = 0.907, $\sigma = 0.074$). Wilcoxon signed-rank statistical tests confirmed that these improvements were statistically significant, even when only a few repetitions were used for fine-tuning. In fact, using transfer learning with just four repetitions instead of eight gave similar accuracy to training from scratch on eight repetitions.
These findings suggest that fine-tuning pre-trained models can significantly lower the effort required to adapt EMG-based systems for new users, offering a practical and effective approach for developing practical interfaces suited to assistive and rehabilitation applications.
